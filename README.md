# Mind Mapper

## User Story
As a web developer, I want an easy to use application to stay organized and productive when I am  working with a team on a large project, so that I can create a game plan to reach an MVP in a short amount of time.

To showcase the knowledge we have all gained through this course so far. Demonstrate problem solving and collaborative techniques. We wanted to create something that will be useful for programmers/developers. Lastly, to accomplish the first few steps of a project so that developers like us can hit the ground running.
